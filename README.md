# Structure-Dependent-T3S

* Implemented a dependency-parsing based algorithm to simulate the Mandarin Tone 3 Sandhi (T3S) process, which yields different patterns of realization of T3S depending on the syntactic structure of the expression.

* The current implementation produced natural output comparable to Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
