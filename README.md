# Structure-Dependent-T3S

* Implemented a dependency-parsing based algorithm to simulate the Tone 3 Sandhi (T3S) process in Mandarin Chinese, which yields different patterns of realization depending on the syntactic structure of the expression.

* Produced more natural output than Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
